<p>Refund policy has been devised to define the situations under which we will provide a refund, the procedure for claiming a refund and the responsibility of AB Web Development in circumstances resulting in such a claim. By registering for any of our services you are declaring that you accept and agree with all the terms and conditions outlined in the refund policy.</p>

<h3>Coverage & Scope</h3>
<p>- This refund policy covers the refunds under my services and/or a website owned and managed by us.</p>

This includes any third party service and / or product providers bound by contract and also, any third-party websites to which my website link.</p>
<h3>Filing a Complaint</h3>
<p>- In our development service, we take every project with the final product in sight. It is as much our responsibility as the client’s. So, we believe that every effort should be made to reach a solution that is fully acceptable reciprocally in case of any situation where dissatisfaction related to services comes. Only when things are completely out of hand that refund should be considered.</p>
<p>- Our final aim is to come to a mutually acceptable solution. Even then if for some reason you are not satisfied and think about going for a refund claim, it is our request that you take out a few precious minutes to write to us at aadityabhutada@gmail.com for a final dialogue prior to requesting a refund.</p>
<p>- Only if we are unable to reach a common ground with you after talks should a refund claim be filed.</p>
